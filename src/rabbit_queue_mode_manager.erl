%% Token-credit based memory management

%% Start off by working out the amount of memory available in the
%% system (RAM). Then, work out how many tokens each byte corresponds
%% to. This is the tokens_per_byte field. When a process registers, it
%% must provide an M-F-A triple to a function that needs one further
%% argument, which is the new mode. This will either be 'mixed' or
%% 'disk'.
%%
%% Processes then report their own memory usage, in bytes, and the
%% manager takes care of the rest.
%%
%% There are a finite number of tokens in the system. These are
%% allocated to processes as they are requested. We keep track of
%% processes which have hibernated, and processes that are doing only
%% a low rate of work. When a request for memory can't be satisfied,
%% we try and evict processes first from the hibernated group, and
%% then from the lowrate group. The hibernated group is a simple
%% queue, and so is implicitly sorted by the order in which processes
%% were added to the queue. This means that when removing from the
%% queue, we hibernate the sleepiest pid first. The lowrate group is a
%% priority queue, where the priority is the truncated log (base e) of
%% the amount of memory allocated. Thus when we remove from the queue,
%% we first remove the queue from the highest bucket.
%%
%% If the request still can't be satisfied after evicting to disk
%% everyone from those two groups (and note that we check first
%% whether or not freeing them would make available enough tokens to
%% satisfy the request rather than just sending all those queues to
%% disk and then going "whoops, didn't help after all"), then we send
%% the requesting process to disk. When a queue registers, it can
%% declare itself "unevictable". If a queue is unevictable then it
%% will not be sent to disk as a result of other processes requesting
%% more memory. However, if it itself is requesting more memory and
%% that request can't be satisfied then it is still sent to disk as
%% before. This feature is only used by the disk_queue, because if the
%% disk queue is not being used, and hibernates, and then memory
%% pressure gets tight, the disk_queue would typically be one of the
%% first processes to get sent to disk, which cripples
%% performance. Thus by setting it unevictable, it is only possible
%% for the disk_queue to be sent to disk when it is active and
%% attempting to increase its memory allocation.
%%
%% If a process has been sent to disk, it continues making
%% requests. As soon as a request can be satisfied (and this can
%% include sending other processes to disk in the way described
%% above), it will be told to come back into mixed mode. We do not
%% keep any information about queues in disk mode.
%%
%% Note that the lowrate and hibernate groups can get very out of
%% date. This is fine, and somewhat unavoidable given the absence of
%% useful APIs for queues. Thus we allow them to get out of date
%% (processes will be left in there when they change groups,
%% duplicates can appear, dead processes are not pruned etc etc etc),
%% and when we go through the groups, summing up their amount of
%% memory, we tidy up at that point.
%%
%% A process which is not evicted to disk, and is requesting a smaller
%% amount of RAM than its last request will always be satisfied. A
%% mixed-mode process that is busy but consuming an unchanging amount
%% of RAM will never be sent to disk. The disk_queue is also managed
%% in the same way. This means that a queue that has gone back to
%% being mixed after being in disk mode now has its messages counted
%% twice as they are counted both in the request made by the queue
%% (even though they may not yet be in RAM (though see the
%% prefetcher)) and also by the disk_queue. Thus the amount of
%% available RAM must be higher when going disk -> mixed than when
%% going mixed -> disk. This is fairly sensible as it reduces the risk
%% of any oscillations occurring.
%%
%% The queue process deliberately reports 4 times its estimated RAM
%% usage, and the disk_queue 2.5 times. In practise, this seems to
%% work well. Note that we are deliberately running out of tokes a
%% little early because of the fact that the mixed -> disk transition
%% can transiently eat a lot of memory and take some time (flushing a
%% few million messages to disk is never going to be instantaneous).
